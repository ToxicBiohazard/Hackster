# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project!

If you are interested in contributing, **this page contains the golden rules to follow when contributing**. Do note that
failing to comply with our guidelines may lead to a rejection of the contribution.

***

## Guidelines

To contribute, please follow these guidelines:

* Look at the current Issues and/or discussions taking place in the #bot-dev channel on Discord for things that needs to
  be done.
* Please create an issue in GitHub. For feature requests wait the community moderators to approve the issue.
* Always create a feature branch for your work.
* Please use pull requests from feature branch to development once you are confident that the implementation is done.
* **Do not open a pull request if you aren't assigned to the issue**. If someone is already working on it, consider
  offering to collaborate with that person.

## Before creating a pull request

Please ensure that the following is fulfilled:

### Functionality and testing

* The code has been tested on your own machine and appears to work as intended.
* The code handles errors and malformed input gracefully.
* The command is implemented in slash commands using the same approach as all other places (if applicable).
* Permissions are set correctly.

### Code quality

* Follow PEP-8 style guidelines, except the maximum line width (which can exceed 80 chars in this repo - we're not in
  the 1970's anymore).
* **Lint before you push**. We have simple but strict style rules that are enforced through linting. You must always
  lint your code before committing or pushing.
* Try/except the actual error which is raised.
* Proofread the code and fix oddities.

***Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.***
